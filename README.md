<h3> Introduction </h3>

The market for low-fat snacks has seemingly grown in affluent countries, whereby consumers have increased interest in obtaining healthier snacks, especially in the United States. Among one of the largest producers of low-fat snacks, BestChip is currently considering the expansion of their production sites into the western states in order to capture part of the increasing market demand.

As companies grow, their customers become more spread out across the market so BestChip aims to regionalize their supply chain in order to better serve their customers through shorter lead times and lower shipping costs. Furthermore, decentralizing their production facilities would lead to reduce risk of supply chain disruptions; i.e. logistical interruptions, production issues etc.

BestChip has the potential to benefit greatly from the expanding market and therefore is considering eight candidate sites among a handful of Western states to meet the demand of various western markets. This case study allows us to provide BestChip with an optimal solution to determine the number of production sites and their location.



<h3>Problem Statement </h3>

The corporate’s main goal is to capitalize on the increase market demand for low-fat snacks across the nation. BestChip currently produces 3 different types of products; regular chips, green onion chips, and party mix.

Each company has an exclusive geographic location and demand for each of the 3 products. This demand is presented at a yearly basis and the new production facility must meet the full demand of each company.

The sites have a different purchase cost, which represents the yearly amortized cost of opening and operating the site, and the material shipping cost from the designated production facility and the respective costumer. Shipping costs are presented as a factor of USD per ton, with each location having different costs for the different ingredients.

BestChip also incurs the cost of shipping the low-fat snacks to their customers, with the cost being determined by the product’s volume and distance from site to consumer.

<h3> Key Results </h3>

<b> LP Output Results: </b>

Our goal was to determine the optimal site locations that would meet customer’s demand, match BestChip’s strategy of opening sites in at most two states as well as their existing product recipes at the minimum possible cost for the company; whereby, our analysis provides a total cost of $1,458,420 based on the current pricing of site purchase cost, product shipping cost, and material shipping cost. As for the optimal sites, we determined that only two sites are required to achieve the minimum possible cost structure; one site in Pomona, California and the other in Tucson, Arizona. Furthermore, the total quantity that would need to be produced is 26,700 tons with the Tucson site providing 11,900 tons and the Pomona site producing 14,800 tons.

<b> GP Output Results: </b>

BestChip will meet all its requirements as it will be able to fulfill the limit on the total number of states the sites must be purchased in, the total capacity of products that can produced at Tucson and Pomona, and also the total demand of regular, green and party mix chips at Square Q, AJ Stores and demand of Regular chips at Sun Quest. More importantly, on reordering the goals, the solutions remain the same and the requirements are always satisfied. The total cost of $2,236,770 will be obtained, that is, the total cost for opening and operating the site is $585,000, the total Shipping cost for all Raw Materials to the selected site locations is $286,490, and the total cost in shipping the products from the selected sites to the customer locations is $1,365,280.
